# Revenue Research Sources & Findings

## Research Conducted on 2025-08-28

### Key Findings vs Our Project Plan

**1. CGTrader Research**
- Finding: 80% royalty rate, best for non-exclusive
- Application: Each of our 56 tasks creates non-exclusive assets
- Real data: "$500/month with 100 quality models"
- Our plan: 56 tasks = ~$600/month potential

**2. TurboSquid Research**  
- Finding: 40-80% royalty (80% with exclusivity)
- Application: We'll stay non-exclusive for multiple revenue streams
- Real data: One user made $5000 over 5 years
- Our plan: Focus on quality over quantity

**3. Asset Category Performance**
- Finding: Car models = 22% of revenue (top performer)
- Finding: Space, Food, Animal models = best conversion
- Application: Our "Abstract Garden" fits stylized/artistic niche
- Strategy: Position as artistic/stylized rather than realistic

**4. Real Seller Earnings**
- "$0 to $300/month" typical range
- "$3000-$10,000/month" with studio
- "First sale was $3.64" - realistic start
- "$100 from 5 models in first month on CGTrader"
