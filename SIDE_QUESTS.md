## How Side Quests Work

1. Side quests unlock based on main task progress
2. Each produces a complete mini-asset (valuable on its own)
3. Memories from side quests fill gaps in the stories
4. Some memories contradict "official" history
5. All memories together reveal the true collaborative nature of CG

## The Meta Story

When all 6 stories complete, they reveal: Computer graphics wasn't created by lone geniuses but by communities - men and women, East and West, corporate and open source - all contributing to the shared dream of making imagination visible.
