## Total Project Value: $3,000

### Monthly Recurring Revenue Model

**Non-Exclusive Licensing (You Keep Ownership)**
- Upload to 5+ marketplaces simultaneously
- Expected 20% monthly sales rate
- $600/month passive income potential

**Marketplace Distribution:**
1. CGTrader (80% royalty) = Primary
2. TurboSquid (40-80% royalty) = CheckMate certified
3. Gumroad (95% royalty) = Direct sales
4. Sketchfab (70% royalty) = Community
5. ArtStation (95% royalty) = Professional

### Growth Strategy

**Month 1-2:** Complete Part 1
- Create foundation assets
- Test marketplace response
- Optimize pricing

**Month 3-4:** Complete Part 2
- Build core asset library
- Bundle related assets
- Start tutorial documentation

**Month 5-6:** Complete Part 3
- Premium content creation
- Launch tutorial course
- Scale to $1000+/month

### Proven Revenue Tactics

1. **Bundle Strategy**
   - Individual assets: $35-95
   - 5-asset bundles: $197 (better value)
   - Complete collection: $497 (best margins)

2. **Quality Multipliers**
   - Basic model: $45
   - + Textures: $65 (+44%)
   - + Rigging: $95 (+111%)
   - + Animation: $125 (+177%)

3. **Seasonal Optimization**
   - Abstract/stylized sells year-round
   - Garden themes peak spring/summer
   - Tutorial sales peak January/September

### Real Examples from Research

- 100 quality models = $500+/month
- 5 models on CGTrader = $100 first month
- Established sellers = $3000-10000/month
- One TurboSquid seller = $5000 over 5 years

### Why This Works

1. **You retain full ownership** - Non-exclusive licensing
2. **Assets appreciate** - More reviews = higher rankings
3. **Passive income** - Upload once, sell forever
4. **Portfolio building** - Each task adds value
5. **Multiple revenue streams** - Models, tutorials, bundles

### Implementation in GitHub

Every closed task now shows:
- Asset value created
- Total portfolio value
- Monthly income potential
- Marketplace recommendations

This turns abstract learning into concrete earning potential, just like growing plants that can be harvested and sold!
