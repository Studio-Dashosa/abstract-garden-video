# ðŸŽ® ABSTRACT GARDEN - COMPLETE GAME SYSTEM DOCUMENTATION

## System Overview

Your Abstract Garden project is now a **fully gamified 3D learning journey** with interconnected systems that track progress, reward achievements, and unlock narrative content as you complete real production tasks.

## Core Mechanics

### 1. XP & Level System (FromSoft-style)
- **XP Earned**: Each task gives 100-500 XP based on complexity

- **Level Benefits**: Unlock new memory fragments and increase portfolio value

### 2. Coin Economy
- **Earn Coins**: 75-165 coins per task based on market value
- **Spend Coins**: Purchase memory fragments early (50-500 coins each)
- **Save Strategy**: Can unlock memories with coins OR wait for XP threshold

### 3. Memory Fragment System (49 Total)
- **XP Unlocking**: Each memory has an XP threshold (progressive scaling)
- **Coin Purchase**: Can buy any memory early with coins

### 6. Portfolio Value Calculation
```
Base Value = Tasks Ã— $100
Side Quest Bonus = Side Quests Ã— $75
Level Bonus = (Level Ã· 5) Ã— $500
Story Bonus = Stories Ã— $200
Masterwork Bonus = $5,000 (if all complete)
---
Total Portfolio Value = Sum of above
Monthly Income = Portfolio Value Ã— 20%
```

As you progress, you're not just learning tools, but joining this lineage of digital creators.

## Support & Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Side quests not appearing**: Check prerequisites (5/10/15 tasks)
2. **Memories not unlocking**: Check XP threshold or purchase with coins

4. **Issues not syncing**: Run update script or check GitHub API

### Debug Commands (Browser Console)

```javascript
// Check current state
dashboard.gameState.getState()

// Add XP for testing
dashboard.gameState.debugAddXP(1000)

// Add coins for testing  
dashboard.gameState.debugAddCoins(500)

// Unlock all memories
dashboard.gameState.debugUnlockAllMemories()

// Reset everything
dashboard.gameState.resetState()
```
